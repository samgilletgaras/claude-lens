# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

AI Lens is a local web app to browse AI coding-assistant session history across
multiple providers (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, …). It reads each provider's
session/config files **directly off disk** and renders them as a timeline of
messages, tool calls, and system events — plus skills, agents, MCPs, memory,
plans, and usage stats.

**The architecture lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md), which is the source of
truth — read it before changing code.** Don't duplicate that detail here:

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — full architecture: backend/frontend split,
  the registry-hub + self-registration pattern, the `all` meta-provider, all 12
  endpoints, the normalized message contract, demo mode, provider dispatch, the
  add-a-provider checklist, and the data-sourcing rules.
- [`docs/claude/README.md`](docs/claude/README.md) — Claude Code's `~/.claude/`
  layout, the session JSONL envelope, and where each feature's data comes from.
- [`docs/cursor/README.md`](docs/cursor/README.md) — Cursor's `~/.cursor/` layout,
  agent-transcript JSONL format, the XML wrapper stripping, and timeline richness
  limitations.
- [`docs/ghcopilot-vscode/`](docs/ghcopilot-vscode/README.md) — VS Code storage
  layout, the `transcripts` ⇄ `chatSessions` merge (why the opening prompt is
  recovered from `chatSessions`), and timeline richness limitations.

## Commands

All commands run from the repo root unless noted.

```bash
npm run dev        # backend + frontend concurrently
npm run dev:api    # Node.js backend on port 3000
npm run dev:web    # Vite dev server on port 5173

# Web only (from src/web/)
npm run build      # TypeScript compile + Vite build
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

No tests are configured yet (`npm test` exits with error).

## Non-negotiable constraints

These govern every change. The full rationale is in `docs/README.md`.

- **Backend is plain JavaScript** (`src/api/`) — no TypeScript, no framework, no
  build step. Node core only (`http`, `fs`, `readline`, `os`, `path`). Split
  across `index.js`, `utils.js`, `config.js`, `providers/`, and `readers/`.
- **Zero vanilla CSS** outside `src/web/src/index.css` — no BEM, no co-located
  `.css` files. All styling is inline Tailwind utility classes.
- **Frontend is fully provider-agnostic.** `/api/config` is the single source of
  truth for provider names, icons, capabilities, and availability. No rendering
  path may compare provider names (`provider === 'ghcopilot'`, etc.); gate on
  `capabilities.*` flags or data shape. Adding a provider must require **zero**
  frontend rendering changes. (Permitted exceptions: `apiUrl`/`slugify`, the
  `PROVIDER_MIGRATIONS` map, `index.css` badge tokens, and `SettingsViewer`.)
- **`getMessages()` must emit the normalized flat event contract.** Every provider's
  reader must flatten its on-disk format into typed role events (`user`, `assistant`,
  `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `thinking`, `system`, `system_attachment`,
  `local_command`) before returning. No `Block[]` arrays, no bundled multi-block
  messages, no provider-specific XML tags. All parsing lives in the reader.
  `MessageBubble` maps `role → display style` only. See `docs/README.md` for the
  full contract table.
- **Backend provider isolation.** Each `readers/<id>/` directory touches only its
  own ecosystem's files. Cursor ≠ GitHub Copilot — a new editor gets a new provider.
- **Local files only, no remote, ever.** Read off disk; never call an API,
  network endpoint, or auth service. Derive paths from `os.homedir()` /
  `os.platform()` (and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` where applicable) — never hardcode a
  username, absolute path, workspace hash, or UUID. Linux + macOS only; Windows
  is out of scope for now.

## Styling tokens

Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` (no `tailwind.config.js`). Custom design
tokens live in `src/web/src/index.css` under `@theme` — always use the `lens-*`
tokens, never raw equivalents.

Markdown content uses `@tailwindcss/typography` (`prose prose-invert`).

## Versioning

To bump the version, update the `version` field in all 3 files: `package.json`,
`src/api/package.json`, `src/web/package.json`.

## Keeping docs current

Documentation is part of the change, not an afterthought. **In the same turn that
you add or change an endpoint, component, view, reader, provider, constraint, or
data-on-disk layout, update the affected docs:**

- `docs/` — the architectural source of truth. Update `docs/README.md` for
  cross-cutting changes (endpoints, the provider model, data-sourcing rules) and
  the relevant `docs/<provider>/` note for provider-specific on-disk details.
- This `CLAUDE.md` — update the constraints, commands, styling tokens, or doc
  pointers above whenever they drift.

Stale docs cause incorrect code generation. If a change makes any statement in
`docs/` or `CLAUDE.md` wrong, fixing it is part of finishing the change.
